## Hi there my name is Morgan 👋

# Who is Morgan? # 

This is me 👇

I am in my *fourth year* of my neuroscience major at Dal!

# Why NESC 3505? # 

I've always liked learning about interpreting data in different ways and I've always been interested in learning more about python coding so when I found this course and it fit into my schedule it was **perfect**! 

# Why neuroscience? #

Coming out of highschool I was still a bit unsure of what I wanted to study but I enjoyed learning about how the brain worked so I thought that neuroscience would be a good start and would open lots of doors that I could look into further down the road. 

# What's the post-grad plan? # 

I'm still pretty unsure of what path to take after my bachelors but I'm currently looking into occupational therapy. There will definitely be some traveling in my future ✈️, even if it isn't immediately after graduation!
